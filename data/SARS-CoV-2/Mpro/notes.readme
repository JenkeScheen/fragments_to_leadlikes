This is almost exclusively Moonshot data. For the leadlikes, compounds under MW 250 were removed and all Tags except "XChem Screen - *", "Crystal contact" and "Surface" were downloaded. For fragments, only compounds in Tags "XChem Screen - *" were downloaded. See https://fragalysis-legacy.xchem.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/preview/target/Mpro/tas/lb18145-1
